# IOT
IoT-Based Heart Health Monitoring and Prediction System is a smart healthcare IoT project designed to continuously monitor vital signs using sensors (MAX30100 and DHT11) and the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system streams this data to the cloud via ThingSpeak and Blynk for real-time visualization and alert notifications to the user.
